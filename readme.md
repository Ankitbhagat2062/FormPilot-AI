##Smart Document & Form Automation System for Students

###⭐ 1. Problem Statement

Students face repeated frustration while filling online forms—scholarships, admissions, internships, exams, or government portals.
Common problems include:

Forms require specific document sizes, formats, and resolutions (e.g., JPG only, <100 KB, 200×200 px).

Students often upload the wrong document, leading to rejection.

Manual compressing, resizing, renaming, converting is time-consuming.

Re-entering the same details across multiple forms leads to mistakes, like wrong DOB, incorrect document upload.

Many students don’t understand technical document requirements.

This leads to rejections, delays, and stress, especially in rural or first-time student communities.
